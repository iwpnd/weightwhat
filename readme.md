## weightwhat?

A crud api written with [fastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) to query and store my weight over time. And a frontend build with [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit).

- backend: fastAPI
- frontend: streamlit

TODO:

- time-series modeling
- authentification
- withings api integration would be cool
